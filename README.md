## Describe your project in a tweet!
We're on a mission to save compostable utensils from the landfill! These items won't break down in a landfill so we're using tech for good to make sure they make it to the nearest composting facility.

## What inspired you to make this?

## What does your project do?
Our project is an environmental hack that can conduct image analysis to distinguish different materials of spoons, knives, and forks (compostable vs. plastic). 

## How did you build it?

## What challenges did you face?
Trying to figure out the appropriate packages to conduct our image analysis. We used a combination OpenCV and Scikit-Image. 

## What accomplishments are you proud of?
Staying up late at night drinking Monster Energy drinks, while single-handly devouring pizzas and cookies in one hand and typing desperately on the computer with the other hand.
